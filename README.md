This is a project of mine, created out of curiosity and my passion to learn more about coding language into GUI, AI's,
and rendering of pixels in order to create a game. This will remain open source, and you're welcome to use any of the code as long as you give credit.

FEATURES
---------
:Main character
:Chicken (mob) with 50 health, randomly chooses what it wants to do, cries when hit by arrow
:Cow (mob) with 100 health, randomly chooses what it wants to do, cries when hit by arrow
:Arrow attacking system (actually moves with the character, this was bug at first, but I think it was an interesting to play around with it.
:Map rendering, saving, and editing
:Map GUI
:Farmer NPC

TODO
------
:Collision checks
:Main player health, and hunger GUI,

CHALLENGES
------------
The biggest challenge for me was to find a way to delay the time in which mobs "thought" about so it won't go crazy and change animations and x,y randomly every pixel.
